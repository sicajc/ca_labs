==1303061== Your program just tried to execute an instruction that Valgrind
==1303061== did not recognise.  There are two possible reasons for this.
==1303061== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code
==1303061==    location.  If you are running Memcheck and you just saw a
==1303061==    warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.
==1303061== 2. The instruction is legitimate but Valgrind doesn't handle it,
==1303061==    i.e. it's Valgrind's fault.  If you think this is the case or
==1303061==    you are not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==1303061== Either way, Valgrind will now raise a SIGILL signal which will
==1303061== probably kill your program.
==1303061== 
==1303061== Process terminating with default action of signal 4 (SIGILL)
==1303061==  Illegal opcode at address 0x113DD3
